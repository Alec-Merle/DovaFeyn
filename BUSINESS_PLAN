## Executive Summary

DovaFeyn is an AI-driven business application designed to act as a digital knowledge and decision support system for companies, with a particular focus on organizations that build tangible products. It leverages modular AI agents representing each department (Engineering, Finance, Marketing, etc.), enabling users to simulate decisions, onboard faster, and collaborate more efficiently. Initially targeting internal use cases such as onboarding and team navigation, DovaFeyn aims to expand toward enterprise-level AI graph modeling, where each department is a dynamic, data-driven node.
